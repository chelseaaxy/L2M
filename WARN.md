# Notice Regarding Unauthorized Use of Official Implementation

Dear [chelseaaxy],

I am the original author of the repository [Sharpiless/L2M](https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M), which contains the official implementation of my ICCV 2025 paper.

It has come to my attention that you have migrated the code to [chelseaaxy/L2M](https://github.com/chelseaaxy/L2M) and marked it as the "official implementation" without my authorization.

I kindly request that you:

1. Remove the false "official implementation" label from your repository.
2. Properly attribute the original source and include a clear link to [Sharpiless/L2M](https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M).
3. Cease any further misrepresentation of the authorship or ownership of the code.

If this issue is not resolved promptly, I may have to take further action through GitHubâ€™s DMCA takedown process to protect my rights.
